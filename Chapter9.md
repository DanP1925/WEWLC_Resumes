# I can't get this class into a Test Harness

The four most common problems we encounter when trying to do this are:

1. Objects of the class can't be created easily.
2. The test harness won't easily build with the class in it.
3. The constructor we need to use has bad side effects.
4. Significant work happens in the constructor, and we need to sense it.
